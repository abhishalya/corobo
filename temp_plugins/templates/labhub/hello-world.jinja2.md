Welcome @{{ target }}! :tada:

To get started, please follow our [newcomers guide](https://coala.io/newcomer). The guide might tell you that corobo's command will get you an invite, but **it won't**, I'm not corobo (he's my father and he's too tired to work atm).

The alternative is to request access to [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/groups/coala/roles/newcomers/) instead. A developer or maintainer will then soon invite you to the organization. But just to let you know, the invite might get delayed since most of our maintainers are busy.

Only after you've received and accepted the invitation, we can assign issues. Until that, feel free to explore coala.
